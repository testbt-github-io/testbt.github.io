# Redirects Example Front-End

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app made explicitly for Payload's [Redirects Example](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/master/examples/redirects/cms).

## Getting Started

### Payload

First you'll need a running CMS. If you have not done so already, open up the `cms` folder alongside this example and follow the setup instructions. Take note of your server URL, you'll need this in the next step.

### Next.js App

1. Clone this repo
2. `cd` into this directory and run `yarn` or `npm install`
3. `cp .env.example .env` to copy the example environment variables
4. `yarn dev` or `npm run dev` to start the server
5. `open http://localhost:3000` to see the result

Once running you will find a couple seeded pages on your local environment with some basic instructions. You can also start editing the pages by modifying the documents within your CMS. See the [Redirects Example CMS](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/master/examples/redirects/cms) for full details.
