# Form Builder Example Website

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) that fetches data from [Payload](https://payloadcms.com).

This example repo was made explicitly to demonstrate the power and convenience of the [Form-Builder plugin](https://github.com/payloadcms/plugin-form-builder). Along with the `Form-Builder plugin`, this repo takes advantage of the popular [React Hooks Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) library for easy validation, giving users an easy way to build and manage forms.

## Getting Started

### Payload

First you'll need a running Payload app. If you have not done so already, open up the `cms` folder and follow the setup instructions. Take note of your server URL, you'll need this in the next step.

### Next.js App

1. Clone this repo
2. `cd` into this directory and run `yarn` or `npm install`
3. `cp .env.example .env` to copy the example environment variables
4. `yarn dev` or `npm run dev` to start the server
5. `open http://localhost:3000` to see the result

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Once running, you will find a few seeded example forms on your local environment. Give them a try!

You can also start editing the pages by modifying the documents within your CMS.
