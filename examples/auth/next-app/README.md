# Payload Auth Example Front-End

This is a [Payload](https://payloadcms.com) + [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) app using the [App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app) made explicitly for the [Payload Auth Example](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/master/examples/auth). It demonstrates how  to authenticate your Next.js app using [Payload Authentication](https://payloadcms.com/docs/authentication/overview).

> This example uses the App Router, the latest API of Next.js. If your app is using the legacy [Pages Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages), check out the official [Pages Router Example](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/master/examples/auth/next-pages).

## Getting Started

### Payload

First you'll need a running Payload app. If you have not done so already, clone down the [`cms`](../cms) folder and follow the setup instructions there to get it up and running. This will provide all the necessary APIs that your Next.js app will be using for authentication.

### Next.js

1. Clone this repo
2. `cd` into this directory and run `yarn` or `npm install`
3. `cp .env.example .env` to copy the example environment variables
4. `yarn dev` or `npm run dev` to start the server
5. `open http://localhost:3001` to see the result

Once running, a user is automatically seeded in your local environment with some basic instructions. See the [Payload Auth Example](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/master/examples/auth) for full details.

## Deployment

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new) from the creators of Next.js. You could also combine this app into a [single Express server](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/master/examples/custom-server) and deploy in to [Payload Cloud](https://payloadcms.com/new/import).

Check out our [Payload deployment documentation](https://payloadcms.com/docs/production/deployment) or the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
